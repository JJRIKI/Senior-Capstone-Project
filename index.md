## Welcome to Nimble
Senior Capstone Project for CS-190

Nimble is a webapp that will take care of organizing your daily routine. This webapp can organize and save your tasks from this week’s assignments, errands, or chores. When organizing your tasks, the user will have a variety of customization based on priority and can save tasks to a backlog to be tackled at a later date. This handy webapp can eliminate those reminders that litter both your physical and digital space like post it notes on the fridge or tabs in your web browser by consolidating it into a single place. The webapp focuses on a week long “sprint”, and after the sprint ends it clears your “tickets”. This is to help the user focus on breaking tasks into manageable sized “tickets”.
