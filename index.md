## Welcome to Nimble
Senior Capstone Project for CS-190

Nimble is a webapp that will take care of organizing your daily routine. This webapp can organize and save your tasks from this week’s assignments, errands, or chores. When organizing your tasks, the user will have a variety of customization based on priority and can save tasks to a backlog to be tackled at a later date. This handy webapp can eliminate those reminders that litter both your physical and digital space like post it notes on the fridge or tabs in your web browser by consolidating it into a single place. The webapp focuses on a week long “sprint”, and after the sprint ends it clears your “tickets”. This is to help the user focus on breaking tasks into manageable sized “tickets”.

## Retrospective
Overall we did our best with the limited experience and time we had for this senior capstone project during Covid-19. Some things that went well was managing the project and focusing on the tasks that required attention, which new tasks to tackle, and any concerns needed to be addressed. Through this project, we also had the opportunity to pursue several different avenues of development to achieve our vision, such as React, Heroku, Docker, PhP, Dragula, Browserfy, clearDB, and jQuery. Some of the hurdles that prevented us from achieving everything we had planned for this project was the unfamiliarity of the FullCalendar API and lack of backend experience, time, and resources. After this class, we’d like to come back to some of these concepts and mistakes and find new opportunities to improve in these areas.

## Licensing
We have decided to go with the MIT license. We chose this particular license as it is open for changing even the source code. Which we thought was best because of our lack of resources. The MIT license would potentially allow developers to polish our product.
